# naming.tf: every resource name derived from var.name_prefix, in one place.
#
# A non-default prefix lets a second instance coexist in the same project, and lets a destroy
# plus redeploy sidestep the indestructible KMS key ring a previous stack left behind.
#
# Length note: GCP service-account ids must be 6 to 30 characters. The longest derived id is
# <prefix>-app, so any prefix the variable's own regex accepts is safe here.
#
# One name is NOT derived: the audit log name. The managed audit adapter
# (src/proactive_outreach/adapters/gcp/audit.py) writes to the logger
# "proactive_outreach-audit" as a code constant, and the WORM sink filter must name the same
# log or it routes nothing. Deriving it from the prefix here would produce a filter that
# quietly matches an empty stream, and a sink that routes nothing looks exactly like a sink
# that works. Change one and change the other in the same commit. It is the only hardcoded
# GCP resource name anywhere in adapters/gcp/.
