#
# Matches the reference stack, adapted for this repo. Every run below uses `mock_provider`, so the
# whole file runs with NO credentials, NO project and NO network beyond the provider download:
#   terraform init -backend=false && terraform test
# The reference runs that were NOT portable are the Mode 5 signing-key stages and the
# installation manifest contract; those belong to its embedded-grant browser flow, which this
# service does not have, and their module does not exist here.
#
# What these runs are for: a residency or fail-closed claim that only lives in a comment is a
# claim nobody checks. Each `expect_failures` run proves that a specific misconfiguration is
# refused at plan time rather than reaching an apply.
