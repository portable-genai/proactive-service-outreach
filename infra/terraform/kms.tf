# kms.tf: one regional Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK), in country.
#
# Principle map (COMPLIANCE.md):
#   P-09 (defence in depth): CMEK DOES NOT CASCADE. A key on one resource does not protect
#         what that resource hands to another service, so every managed service that encrypts
#         with this key gets its OWN service-agent binding below, and each resource names the
#         key in its own file. There is no project-wide grant anywhere in this stack.
#   P-03 (residency): the key ring location is var.region, a REGIONAL key ring, never the
#         global or multi-region one. Regional CMEK is what pins the crypto material in
#         country alongside the decisions and audio it protects.
#
# THREE services this stack talks to get no binding here, deliberately, because a key grant to
# a service agent that encrypts nothing is an IAM grant nobody can point at a resource for:
#   - BigQuery: the event view is the CLIENT's (warehouse.tf creates no dataset and no table),
#     so this stack owns no BigQuery resource to encrypt. The view's own encryption is the
#     client's decision in the project that holds it.
#   - Text-to-Speech: synthesis is stateless. The audio comes back in the response and the
#     adapter writes it to the bucket itself, so the CMEK that matters is the BUCKET's, below.
#   - Dialogflow CX: the agent is the client's and is not created here.
# Add the binding in the same commit that creates a resource for it, never before.
#
# NOTE: key rings are indestructible. `terraform destroy` cannot remove the ring, so a
# redeploy into the same project must either import it or use a fresh var.name_prefix
# (naming.tf derives the ring and key names from it).
