# providers.tf: provider pinning and state for the E5 Proactive Service Outreach service.
#
# Principle map (COMPLIANCE.md):
#   P-03 (single region / residency): every provider call is pinned to var.region, which is
#         SELECTED AT DEPLOY TIME and validated against an allowlist (variables.tf). There is
#         no global or multi-region default; the default is asia-southeast1, the one region
#         this service is licensed to decide about and contact people from.
#   P-02 (no lock-in): Terraform is the only place infrastructure is described. The app talks
#         to ports, never to these resources.
#
# The GA google provider covers everything but one resource: google_model_armor_template
# (model_armor.tf, rule R1) is google-beta only on the pinned provider version, so the beta
# provider is declared for that resource alone. Anything else beta-only uses this same provider.

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.9.0"

  # Partial backend. `terraform init -backend-config=...` supplies the reviewed state bucket
  # and the per-installation prefix, so neither is committed here and the module stays
  # reusable across installations. Keeping the declaration active is what makes accidental
  # local state impossible in a real runner; `-backend=false` is for offline validation only.
