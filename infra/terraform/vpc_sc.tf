# vpc_sc.tf: the VPC Service Controls perimeter around the AI and data plane.
#
# Principle map (COMPLIANCE.md):
#   P-01 / P-03 (hybrid posture and residency): a service perimeter draws a logical boundary
#         around the sovereignty-critical APIs (Vertex AI, Text-to-Speech, Dialogflow,
#         BigQuery, Logging, KMS, Secret Manager, Storage). The operational events a decision
#         is made from, the synthesised audio a customer hears and the audit trail of who was
#         and was not contacted cannot be read across that boundary into an
#         out-of-jurisdiction project, which is what stops subject data leaving the country
#         even when an identity inside the project is compromised.
#   P-01 (least surface): only the services this stack uses are inside the perimeter.
#
# Two toggles:
#   var.enable_vpc_sc  - create the perimeter at all. Requires var.access_policy_id (validated
#                        at plan time in variables.tf); set it false for a project-scoped quick
#                        deploy without one.
#   var.vpc_sc_enforce - enforce (true) or DRY-RUN / audit (false, the default). Apply with
#                        false first, watch the dry-run violations that the vpc_sc_denials
#                        alert surfaces, add the operator identities to an access level, then
#                        flip to true. Implemented with use_explicit_dry_run_spec: in dry run
#                        the restricted services live in `spec` (audited, not enforced) and
#                        `status` stays open.
#
# NOTE on egress: VPC-SC governs access to GOOGLE APIs across perimeters, not arbitrary
# internet egress. This service makes TWO outbound calls to non-Google hosts, and both are
# ordinary HTTPS: the consent question to the Mkt6 store (P-13) and the escalation routed to
# the Hrz7 console (rule R8). Both are a VPC firewall and Cloud NAT concern, not a VPC-SC
# egress rule. Run the service with egress that reaches exactly those two hosts and nothing
# else; a service that can reach the open internet can be told to contact somebody through it.
