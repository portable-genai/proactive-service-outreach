"""The demo surface, asserted from inside the offline gate.

A demo that is only ever run by hand before a meeting is a demo that breaks in the meeting. The
hosted Cloud Build check runs the real walkthrough headless (``make demo-selftest``) on every
pull request and push to main; this module is the cheaper half that runs in ``make gate``, so a
broken demo fails the same command a developer already runs before committing.

What is asserted here is not "the files exist". It is that the demo's ARC and its ASSERTIONS
cannot drift apart, and that the arc actually holds when the real services are driven through
it. The scripts are importable from the suite (``pythonpath = ["scripts"]`` in
``pyproject.toml``), so this drives the same code the presenter drives.
